## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.1] - 2026-03-18
### Changed
- Refactored `run_review()` into 4 phase functions for maintainability.
- Replaced `ArgumentParser.error` monkeypatch with `_StreamSafeParser` subclass.
- Improved CLI help text for `--file` priority and per-provider vs global timeout clarity.

### Fixed
- `adapter.cancel()` failures are now logged instead of being silently swallowed.
- Duplicate agent names in `agents.yaml` now emit a warning and only the first entry is registered.
- Removed the unused `load_state` import.
- `mco agent check` now rejects empty agent names.
- Debate rounds now skip early when zero findings exist.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-18
### Added
- Consensus engine with agreement-based scoring (`consensus_score`, `confirmed` / `needs-verification` / `unverified`).
- `--stream live` for real-time terminal progress per provider.
- `--debate` mode for structured multi-agent challenge rounds.
- `--divide files|dimensions` for task splitting across providers.

- `has_consensus_fallback` field in synthesis output.

### Changed
- `--synthesize` now produces algorithm-driven consensus analysis plus optional agent narrative.
- Findings are sorted by consensus level and then consensus score.
- SARIF confidence now maps to `consensus_score`.
- Markdown PR output now groups findings by consensus level.

### Fixed
- `--divide files` no longer collects non-source directories.
- Empty file-slice providers are skipped instead of scanning the full repository.

### Added
- `--chain` mode for sequential multi-agent analysis.
- `--perspectives-json` for per-provider review focus.
- Consensus badges (`[N/M agree]` and chain-specific confirmed-by labels) in human-readable outputs.
- Session result retrieval for queued or asynchronous session runs.

### Changed
- Session retry behavior now classifies errors and applies exponential backoff.

- `mco session ensure`, `--no-wait`, and Ctrl+C-aware session cancellation improvements.
- ACP expansion with structured rendering plus bidirectional filesystem and terminal handlers.

### Fixed

- Hardened ACP permission keys and launch-flag handling.
- Improved thread safety around pending session state and streaming buffers.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-16
### Added
- Stateful multi-turn sessions via `mco session`.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-16
### Added
- Diff-only review mode with `--diff`, `--staged`, and `--unstaged`.

- Agent reliability scoring, task classification, and tech-stack priors.
- `mco findings` and `mco memory` subcommands.

### Fixed
- Correctness fixes for canonical latest-view deduplication, category-aware priors, `memory_id` propagation, and per-finding changed-file tracking.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-03-10
### Changed
- Default providers list now includes all 5 supported providers (claude, codex, gemini, opencode, qwen) instead of only claude and codex.
- Claude adapter: permission mode `plan` → `bypassPermissions` for full tool execution.
- Codex adapter: sandbox `workspace-write` → `danger-full-access` for full filesystem and network access.
- Gemini adapter: added `-y` (YOLO mode) for automatic tool approval in non-interactive mode.
- Qwen adapter: added `-y` (YOLO mode) for automatic tool approval in non-interactive mode.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-02-27
### Added
- Added `mco doctor` command with human-readable and `--json` outputs to probe provider binary/auth readiness.
- Added `--format markdown-pr` (review-only) to render PR-ready Markdown summaries from aggregated findings.
- Added opt-in `--include-token-usage` to include best-effort provider token usage and aggregate token summary in outputs.
- Added `--format sarif` (review-only) to emit SARIF 2.1.0 output for code scanning integrations.
- Added opt-in synthesis pass via `--synthesize` and `--synth-provider`, returning structured `synthesis` output (consensus/divergence/next steps) in JSON and artifacts.

### Changed
- Added deterministic cross-provider findings deduplication in review aggregation and `findings.json`, with merged `detected_by` provenance and max-confidence rollup.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-02-27
### Changed
- Added run-mode answer extraction fields per provider: `final_text`, `response_ok`, and `response_reason`, while keeping `output_text` as raw output for debugging.
- Improved `final_text` extraction quality for event-stream outputs by preferring high-signal answer candidates over trailing low-signal tokens.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-27
### Changed
- Made stdout mode truly non-persistent by default: no artifact files are written unless `--save-artifacts` or `--result-mode artifact/both` is used.
- In stdout mode without artifact writes, `artifact_root` and provider `output_path` now return `null`.
- Unified adapter detect/probe binary resolution and environment handling with runtime execution (`shutil.which` + sanitized env) and refined auth probe reason classification (`auth_check_failed`, `probe_config_error`, `probe_unknown_error`).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-27
### Changed
- Disabled runtime idempotency/dispatch cache replay; repeated invocations now always re-execute providers.
- Extended stdout payloads and human-readable output to include full per-provider output text (not only excerpt).
- Removed legacy idempotency/state/cache knobs and fields (`--idempotency-key`, `--state-file`, `created_new_task`, `deduped_dispatch`, `dispatch_key`).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-26
### Changed
- Changed default CLI delivery mode to stdout-first (`--result-mode stdout`) so agent callers receive results directly without mandatory artifact reads.
- Added `--save-artifacts` to explicitly persist artifact files while keeping stdout result delivery.
- Updated benchmark script to explicitly opt into artifact persistence (`--save-artifacts`).
- Repositioned README (EN/CN) messaging around "Any Prompt. Any Agent. Any IDE." and clarified caller-agent orchestration scenarios.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-26
### Changed
- Removed config-file mode from CLI; `mco` now uses built-in defaults with flag-only overrides.
- Removed `--config` from `mco run` / `mco review`; passing it now errors as unsupported.
- Updated benchmark automation to run without config files and to report provider set directly.
- Updated README (EN/CN) to document zero-config usage with CLI flag overrides only.

### Removed
- Removed config file loading path (`load_review_config`) and related YAML/JSON config parsing.
- Removed sample config files (`mco.example.json`, `mco.step3-baseline.json`).

## [0.1.3] - 2026-02-26
### Added
- Added release documentation in Simplified Chinese under `docs/releases/`.
- Added environment sanitization for provider subprocesses to strip `CLAUDECODE`.

### Changed
- Aligned review findings schema and parser contract by making `evidence.line` and `evidence.symbol` optional keys.
- Clarified installation channels in docs: npm available now, PyPI pending Trusted Publisher setup.

### Fixed
- Implemented real retry backoff sleep in runtime retry loop.
- Released adapter run handles in terminal and cancel paths to avoid in-memory handle growth.
- Switched CLI config parsing to fail-fast for invalid `--provider-timeouts` and `--provider-permissions-json`.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-02-26
### Added
- Added packaging metadata (`pyproject.toml`) and `mco` console entrypoint.
- Added npm wrapper package (`@osanoai/mco`) for Node-based environments.
- Added publishing workflows for PyPI and npm.

### Changed
- Updated repository naming and distribution identity to `mco`.
- Updated README and release docs for install and usage guidance.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-26
### Added
- Added provider permission contract docs.
- Added release governance artifacts (`CODEOWNERS`, release notes updates).

### Fixed

- Fixed npm workflow syntax/guard issues for reliable CI execution.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-26
### Added
- Initial runnable runtime for multi-provider orchestration (`run` and `review` commands).
- Provider adapters for `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `opencode`, and `qwen`.
- Progress-driven timeout handling, retry semantics, idempotent dispatch, and notification dedupe.
- Canonical findings normalization, review decisioning, and artifact outputs (`summary.md`, `decision.md`, `findings.json`, `run.json`).
- Runtime gate, adapter contract tests, and benchmark/probe scripts.
